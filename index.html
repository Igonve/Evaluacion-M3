            <p class="lead">Tn the past five years, the field of GPCR structure has exploded. 
                GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) are small membrane-spanning proteins, 
                with most of their surface buried inside the membrane. This makes them 
                notoriously difficult to crystallize. However, there is a great incentive to 
                determine these structures: GPCRs are at the center of signaling pathways 
                that control all manner of essential processes, ranging from vision to carcinogenesis,
                and thus are important targets for therapeutic intervention. </p>

        <p id="p1">Recently,the development of clever engineering techniques, such as fusing soluble proteins to the 
            receptor or decorating them with antibodies or nanobodies, have provided crystallographic structures for a
            wide range of GPCRs with diffusable ligands.</p>

            <p id="p2"> By comparing the different GPCR structures, researchers at the PSI GPCR Network have revealed 
                a few common themes in their form and function, as shown here on the beta2 adrenergic receptor 
                (PDB entry 2rh1). As expected, all have the characteristic seven alpha helices passing up and 
                down through the membrane, connected by loops that extend into the surrounding solvent on both 
                sides of the membrane.</p>
